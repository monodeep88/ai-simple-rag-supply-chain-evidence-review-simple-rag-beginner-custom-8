# Supply Chain Evidence Review Simple RAG

## Project Overview

Supply Chain Evidence Review Simple RAG is a complete full-stack AI project for **Simple RAG** at **Beginner** difficulty. It includes a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, sample documents, vector search with ChromaDB support, source citations, timeline logs, structured run storage, Docker files, and tests.

Supply Chain Evidence Review involves analyzing data from various sources to identify trends, risks, and opportunities in a supply chain. This project aims to create a simple RAG (Red, Amber, Green) system to categorize evidence based on its significance and impact.

Difficulty controls project complexity, architecture depth, AI model selection, and how advanced the generated codebase is.

- Architecture depth: minimal backend, simple folder structure, easy README, low-cost/free model
- Selected architecture: PDF FAQ Knowledge Bot
- Template path: templates/simple-rag/pdf-faq-knowledge-bot
- Generated stack: FastAPI backend, React UI, local vector fallback, simple tests
- README style: beginner-friendly setup and clear expected output

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- AI/RAG: LangChain-ready prompt layer, ChromaDB vector storage, local deterministic fallback model
- Workflow: Agent pipeline with planner, retrieval, tool, reasoning, and final answer steps
- Frontend: React and Vite
- Database: SQLite by default, PostgreSQL through Docker Compose
- Testing: pytest
- Difficulty: Beginner

## Generation Method

This project was generated with a template-based architecture engine. AI is used only for the blueprint, domain customization, sample data, prompts, and documentation. The codebase is produced from tested FastAPI/React/Docker templates rather than raw LLM source output.

## Project Type Satisfaction Map

This generated project satisfies **Simple RAG** through the runtime path below. The implementation is not only a README claim: the files listed after the diagram are generated in the repository and validated before GitHub push.

Runtime proof points:

- `frontend/src/App.jsx` renders the user workspace, starter prompts, answer panel, cited sources, and timeline.
- `backend/app/main.py` exposes `POST /api/ask` and returns the final answer, sources, timeline steps, and project type.
- `backend/app/services/pipeline.py` orchestrates the project-type flow: Retriever, Citation Answer Builder.
- `backend/app/services/vector_store.py` loads sample documents and retrieves relevant cited context.
- `backend/app/domain.py` contains the generated topic-specific workflow steps, business rules, tools, persona, and starter questions.
- `backend/app/db.py` stores each run so the generated app behaves like a real workflow tool instead of a static prompt demo.
- `backend/tests/test_project_contract.py` validates the API contract and project-type behavior.

Type-specific behavior:

- Flow style: User question -> load documents -> split chunks -> embed -> Chroma similarity search -> answer with citations.
- Visible output: final answer, cited sources, timeline steps, and project type.
- Validation gate: pytest, frontend build, Docker Compose config, and Docker build before repository upload.

## Environment Variables

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

The app runs without an OpenAI key by using a deterministic local answer model. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to use LangChain with OpenAI.

## Installation

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Run With Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Example API Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ask ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"question\": \"What is the refund policy?\"}"
```

## Example User Question

```text
What should I do if a customer asks for a refund without an order id?
```

## Expected Output

The API returns:

- `answer`: a grounded answer generated from retrieved context
- `sources`: cited document chunks with similarity scores
- `steps`: planner, retriever, reasoning, tool-call, and final-answer timeline logs
- `project_type`: `Simple RAG`

## How The RAG/Agent Flow Works

User question -> load documents -> split chunks -> embed -> Chroma similarity search -> answer with citations.

## Project Planner Agent Workflow

User -> React Dashboard -> FastAPI -> Project Planner Agent -> Specialist Agents -> Generated Project -> Auto Testing -> GitHub Repository Creation -> Push Code -> Return GitHub URL

- **Architecture Agent**: Define app boundaries, data flow, runtime stack, and integration points. Outputs: Use Docker to containerize services for easy deployment and management; Implement API Gateway to handle incoming requests and route them to respective services; Use PostgreSQL as the database to store and manage data.
- **Backend Agent**: Design FastAPI modules, service contracts, validation, and error handling. Outputs: Data Ingestion Module (FastAPI); Data Processing Module (Python); Data Visualization Module (React).
- **Frontend Agent**: Design React screens, state flow, controls, and user feedback states. Outputs: User-friendly interface for data visualization; Filtering and sorting capabilities for evidence review; RAG system for categorizing evidence.
- **Database Agent**: Design persistence models, sample data, indexes, and audit records. Outputs: Run history; Source document metadata; Generated workflow audit records.
- **Testing Agent**: Define contract tests, smoke tests, and generated project validation. Outputs: Unit testing and integration testing using Pytest and Jest.
- **DevOps Agent**: Define environment variables, Docker workflow, and repository packaging. Outputs: Docker-ready project; Environment sample file; GitHub repository upload.
- **Reviewer Agent**: Review the generated plan for completeness, security, and portfolio quality. Outputs: Data ingestion and processing; Evidence categorization using RAG system; Data visualization and analysis.

## AI-Customized Domain Workflow

- Data ingestion and processing
- Evidence categorization using RAG system
- Data visualization and analysis

## Business Rules

- Evidence must be categorized based on its significance and impact
- RAG system must be user-friendly and easy to understand

1. The backend loads sample documents from `backend/app/data/sample_docs`.
2. Documents are split into chunks.
3. Chunks are embedded and stored in ChromaDB when available, with a local fallback for development.
4. User questions are matched against relevant chunks.
5. Agent-specific steps run: planner, retriever, tool call, reasoning, reviewer, or graph nodes.
6. The final answer is returned with source citations and a timeline.

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

## Validation Gates Before GitHub Push
